# ContentCrane: AI Content Repurposing Tool

## Overview
ContentCrane is an AI-powered tool that transforms a single piece of text into multiple platform-optimized formats.

- **Advanced Customization:** Choose content type, target audience, tone, length, industry, and call-to-action.
- **Segmented Output:** Each platform's output is structured and visually segmented for easy review and copy.
- **Modern UI:** Responsive, animated, and user-friendly interface built with React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS.
- **MVP Usage Limit:** Each user can generate content up to 5 times per month (tracked via cookies) to help manage API costs.
